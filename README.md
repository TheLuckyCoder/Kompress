Kompress is a port of the [Apache Compress](https://github.com/apache/commons-compress) library to be usable on Android 4.1 and above.
Besides rewriting the project Kotlin and adding support for older Android Versions, this lightweight version only supports Zip files.

On top of that the parallel API has been rewritten to use Kotlin Coroutines.

## Usage

}
```
